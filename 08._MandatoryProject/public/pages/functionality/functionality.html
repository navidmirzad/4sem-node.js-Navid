<h2>Over the past few weeks of this Node course we have also worked with</h2>

<h1>What is Express?</h1>
<h2>NodeJS is a open source runtime for JavaScript. Additionally we have used the <i>Express</i> whichs is a framework.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Express is a popular web framework, used for web applications.
    </li>
    <li>
        Great at creating robust APIs with minimal effort thanks to its routing.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Since we use Node.JS as our backend runtime enviroment to allow us write server-side code using JavaScript</h2>
<h3>Nodemon is a great tool, we install by writing <i>"npm install -g nodemon"</i> which adds it to our package.json file. <br>
Nodemon allows us to detect changes in our code base. So if there is an error in our code, it even lets us know where.</h3>
<p>Nodemon is also customizeable, for example in our nodemon.json we told it listen to js, json, & html</p>
